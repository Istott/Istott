Hello Github visitor! ðŸ˜ƒ Welcome to my Profile! ðŸ‘‹

![Isaac's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Istott)

I'm rarely on here anymore. I mainly use this account to test new technologies, play around learning something new or teaching/mentoring others.

My current favorite stack that I code in everyday at work is:
- TypeScript
- React
- Redux ToolKit / Saga
- MUI
